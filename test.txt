Here is an example of a 2d top down view in the Rust programming language using the Bevy game engine:

Copy code
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::build()
        .add_resource(Msaa { samples: 4 })
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_startup_system(setup.system())
        .add_system(player_movement_system.system())
        .add_system(camera_follow_system.system())
        .run();
}

fn setup(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>,
) {
    // load the player sprite
    let player_sprite = asset_server
        .load_sync(&mut materials, "assets/sprites/player.png")
        .unwrap();

    // create the player entity
    commands
        .spawn(SpriteComponents {
            material: materials.add(player_sprite.into()),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .with(Player);
}

fn player_movement_system(time: Res<Time>, keyboard_input: Res<Input<KeyCode>>, mut query: Query<(&Player, &mut Translation)>) {
    for (player, mut translation) in &mut query.iter() {
        // get the player's current position
        let mut position = translation.0;

        // update the player's position based on keyboard input
        if keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::W) {
            position.y += time.delta_seconds * PLAYER_SPEED;
        }
        if keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::S) {
            position.y -= time.delta_seconds * PLAYER_SPEED;
        }
        if keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::A) {
            position.x -= time.delta_seconds * PLAYER_SPEED;
        }
        if keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::D) {
            position.x += time.delta_seconds * PLAYER_SPEED;
        }

        // update the player's translation
        translation.0 = position;
    }
}

fn camera_follow_system(mut query: Query<(&Player, &Translation)>) {
    // get the player's position
    let (player, translation) = query.iter().next().unwrap();

    // create a new camera entity and set its position to follow the player
    Camera::new(translation.0).build();
}

// define the player component
struct Player;

const PLAYER_SPEED: f32 = 100.0;
In this example, the setup function loads the player sprite and creates the player entity. The player_movement_system updates the player's position based on keyboard input, and the camera_follow_system creates a camera entity and sets its position to follow the player. This creates a 2d top down view where the player is centered on the screen and the world moves around them as they move.
